Description as a Tweet:
No Belly Left Behind enables residents of the Greater Seattle Area to quickly locate nearby COVID emergency food and meals. Our Android application leverages a real-time information database to provide users with important information regarding each emergency food location.

Inspiration:
Due to the formidable COVID-19 disease, US unemployment rates have increased at an alarming rate. Even with the federal stimulus act in place, many are struggling to stay afloat. Although some have been fortunate enough to easily adjust to a quarantined/virtual lifestyle, many have found themselves asking questions like how they can afford their next meal, how they can provide food for their family, how will their children eat?

The Greater Seattle Area was the first known epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. Before long, everything shut down and quarantine began. And not long after that, with the economy in the slumps, people began to lose their jobs.

No Belly Left Behind’s mission is to make sure that no belly is left behind. To achieve this goal, we give people an easy way to find out where they can get emergency food and meals.

What it does:
Our Android application enables users to quickly locate nearby COVID emergency food and meals. When the app is first opened, the user can see their own location as well as surrounding map markers indicating places where emergency food is provided. The user can drag the map to move around as well as use the search bar to survey a different location. Our application also includes a filters button that allows the users to filter which food location markers to display. For example, some locations are catered towards the youth, while others are catered toward the general public. Users can also filter by distance and open hours. When a marker is clicked, additional information is displayed including information such as a website link, phone number, hours of operation, the address, target audience, and the agency hosting the site.

How we built it:
To build No Belly Left Behind, we used Android App Studio, the Google Maps SDK, and Google Firebase. The main file types we worked with are, Java, XML, JSON, and CSV. Our map feature is the main feature of our application and we leveraged the Google Maps SDK to display custom map markers based on our latitude/longitude data and the user’s current location. Because the type of data we are displaying can change over time, we decided to use a realtime database hosted by Google Firebase which allows us to store our data in the cloud. We got our data from Seattle’s public data set. This dataset can be found here: https://data.seattle.gov/Community/COVID-Emergency-Food-and-Meals-Seattle-and-King-Co/kkzf-ntnu
